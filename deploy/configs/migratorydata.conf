#            token defined by the parameter EntitlementAllowToken
#  - JWT:    Allows clients to subscribe and publish based on JWT tokens using the
#            MigratoryData JWT Authorization add-on. To start using JWT authorization
#            with MigratoryData, please read the JWT Authorization add-on documentation:
#            https://migratorydata.com/docs/addons/authorization-jwt/
#  - Custom: Allows to use your entitlement rules. MigratoryData provides
#            an authorization API library to easily build authorization rules
#            and load them into the MigratoryData server as an extension
#            To learn how to build and load an entitlement plug-in, please
#            refer to Server Extensions API:

#
# Start the MigratoryData server as root (this is necessary to be able to
# bind on the privileged ports such as 80 or 443). Please note that while
# running as root, the MigratoryData server will not accept any client connection.
# Then, the MigratoryData server will drop the root privileges (using the
# system call setuid) and will automatically switch to the regular user
# "migratorydata". Only at this time, the MigratoryData server will start to
# accept client connections.
#
# NOTE: This parameter is available only for Linux.

# Each MigratoryData server in a cluster communicates with the other

# other cluster members, including to itself.
#
# NOTE: This password is used only by the MigratoryData servers that form the
#       cluster to connect each other. This password is not used for clients.
#       In order to allow or deny subscriptions and publications for clients,
#       you can enable the entitlement service via the parameter
#       Extension.Entitlement and implement your authorization rules using
#       MigratoryData Entitlement API.

# Define the quality-of-service level for message delivery that your cluster of

#  - Guaranteed: Guaranteed Message Delivery
#
# Using Standard Message Delivery, in the case of a failover reconnection, the
# client will get the latest (most recent) message available at the moment of
# the reconnection for each topic subscribed by the client.
#
# Using Guaranteed Message Delivery, in the case of a failover reconnection, the
# client will get not only the latest (most recent) message for each of its
# subscribed subjects, but it will also get all the potential messages published
# during the failover period for each of its subscribed subjects.
#
# See MigratoryData Architecture Guide to learn more about the Standard Message
# Delivery and Guaranteed Message Delivery modes.
#
# This is optional, if not supplied the default value will be "Standard".
